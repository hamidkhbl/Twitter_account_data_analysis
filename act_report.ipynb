    "[@WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is a popular twitter account, with over 8.5 million followers who rate dogs. It is simple; people send their dog's photo and [@WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) rates the dog out of 10. Because all the dogs are cute and lovely, usually ratings are above 10! so it is usual to see 13/10 or 14/10 scores! here is an example:\n",

    ">This is Hercules. He would like to discuss a job opportunity with you. The job is gently scratching behind his ears. It comes with many benefits and you can start immediately. 14/10\n",

    "This twitter account has rated many dogs over the last five years, and they have collected a massive dataset of dog photos. It is interesting to see some insights of this data. In this article, I want to share some findings from the analysis that I have done on this dataset. Let's start with scores and number of likes!"
